_This post was inspired by a post I read called_ [_intentional internet_](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdezzie.blog%2Freflections%2Fintentional-internet%2F&t=NzlkODZkOTkzNWQ2NjA5YTMyMjA3YWE2MDJlMjhlM2FhZmQwZjM2MixUZlBUUG5INA%3D%3D&b=t%3A9kRtZeCTmM79cxjYm3jNUQ&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwhoisronbronson.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F187889584420%2Fon-disparate-connections-being-extremely-online&m=0) _on another person’s blog._  
  
I’ve struggled with writing blog posts, because I feel like I need some catalyst. It all boils down to people, really. My need for connection online stems from working remote and not having my close friends nearby. I picked a city (s/o to PDX) that while it has a lot of cool stuff to do and keeps me busy, being peripatetic over the years came at a cost of having disparate connections instead of close ones.

I’ve dated people who have friends they’ve maintained through high school or college, or moved here years ago and kept close friends in tow through proper care and feeding. It’s been revelatory to discover how “the other half lives” as I can only cite close friends strewn about the country, borne largely through being extremely online. My best childhood friends live in New Jersey and while it’s pretty normal when I see them IRL, I don’t go back enough and even if I lived there, it wouldn’t be the same. (They’re all married…)

My lease ends in a few weeks, so I’ve been thinking a lot about what that means. I’ve always assumed that I’ll just move down the street because I like my general part of town. Also moving _is the worst_ and I can’t really fathom if I’d be able to go anywhere that would be easier than being here. Maybe somewhere with better weather, perhaps a few closer friends. But part of the reason I’m so obsessed with process (on-boarding, liminality) in design, is because I’ve spent so much of my life constantly adapting to new places.

I’m not sure what it’d be like to really spend a decade in one particular city. But turning 40 has made me think more proactively about where I’d like to “end up” because I can’t imagine spending my 40s dipdotting around the country (or beyond) as it gets increasing more difficult to make friends; especially when you’re kind of an introvert to begin with.

Dating in a city with transients is funny, because everyone always wants to know “whether you like it here” and “if you think you’ll stay…” because you know that nobody wants to get attached to someone that’s going to pick up and leave in a year or two; or who gets restless at a certain point because not everyone’s life is as easily transferable as I’ve found mine.

I’m sure that I’ll feel even weirder when I have to deal with like, real challenges that I’ve seen from my other friends – a parent’s death or health issues – and part of my desire for consistency and assembling where I want to be, is try to structure my life to have community that’s recurring. I think I’ve joined boards in an attempt to find that, or maybe started groups to find it. It’s very hit or miss and it leaves the actual work of whatever I’m doing a little unsatisfying because I’ve found it leaves me bereft of the sorts of connect I’m seeking.

I know these aren’t unique challenges and whenever I talk to friends with less free time, these sorts of things sound comical as real issues because I clearly just have too much time on my hands, but I think we’re all trying to assess our lives from the starting blocks we’ve arrived at.

On the internet piece, I’ve been slowly trying to care less about what’s going on via Twitter. Or deciding what to post on Instagram. I find algorithms and scrolling feeds toxic. I spent a good part of the summer with the apps deleted from my phone and that was kind of helpful. But I’d just invent new reasons to use them from a different device and now I’m back to where I was.

Meeting new people is exhausting. Onboarding to new spaces is a mental tax. I’m good at sequestering, but I like my more social self a lot better. I’m not sure there’s a right way to do this, it’s just a matter of figuring out how to enjoy the process more than lamenting what’s missing.
